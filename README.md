# StackOverFlow_API

*The program gets a newslist (in the format "publication date" "link" "title") for the last 2 days from the stackoverflow site with a certain tag (in this case "Python"). 
You can change the tag ("tagged" parameter). if you needn't to show all newslist just comment out the "While/else" block.*
